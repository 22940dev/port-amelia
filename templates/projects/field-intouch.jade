            h3 About the Project
            p Field InTouch is a versatile, modular platform providing sales forces with a single application for their core needs in the field. It is an iPad app and platform developed by CLD, and I regularly produce interactive slidedecks/mini-apps that are housed within in the app.
            p Over the last three years, we have worked consistently to make these decks more and more impressive, and our clients love them. Through FiT, they are able to get otherwise unattainable analytics about their field force and the force is able to enjoy their sales material with levels of interactivity and excitement just not achievable by their traditional means and resources.
            p The majority of the work I do is for our largest client, Imperial Tobacco. My work is used all around the world and I have localised decks for the U.S, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Estonia, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Iraq.

            h3 My Approach
            p While I'm generally working with branding dictated by the client/brand, I am able to push the boundaries with the visuals in order to make the decks as fun and exciting for the reps and their audiences. 
            p In these decks, the content is generally the promotion of a new product or feature, so my role is initally to come up with creative concepts for ways to represet this information, including questions with interactive answer mechanics and simple games.
            p Technically, I am responsible for creating the entire front-end of each deck. I get to have a lot of fun experimenting with cool CSS features and animations, while still being careful to optmise for older generation iPads as well as newer ones. Our FiT decks are Brunch apps, utilising Jade, Sass and CoffeeScript.
            p Obviously the content is somewhat sensitive, but I'd be happy to arrange a way to show you some of my work!
