			h2 
				| hi there!
				br 
				| I'm a mobile + web designer

			div#about-me
				p I have a Bachelor in Design Computing from The University of Sydney, and currently work as a mobile app / web designer for a small company in Manly, Sydney.

						h3.heading Little Boxes
						p Little Boxes is an interactive digital art installation created in a group as part of a Human Computer Experience Design Studio. It is a reflection on history. It aims to reconcile personal narratives to the reporting of events; intermingling statuses, photos and tweets with news, movies and songs of the past. Various wooden boxes of different sizes, shapes and designs are scattered through the space, each with their own screen stored inside.
						// p Essentially acting as a digital time capsule, Little Boxes allows the viewer to explore their own personal digital history through the past. As the work evolves, each of the viewers' personal narratives adds to a collective history. The work explores the act of sharing our digital stories: as memory itself becomes digitised, how will this affect our personal narratives and our identities?
						// p Little Boxes is made using HTML and websocket technologies, and an Arduino on an iMac, iPod touches, iPads and a tablet PC.

						h3.heading Unicef Mobile Site
						p I designed a website for Unicef optimised for mobile devices. The brief wanted us to make it as easy as possible for users to donate on the go, as well as sign up for a newsletter and learn more about the top 10 causes.
						p My design was chosen as the best in the class, in terms of mobile optimisation.
