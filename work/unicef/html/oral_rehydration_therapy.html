        <p>Every year almost two million children die needlessly from diarrhoeal dehydration. A simple course of Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) is often all that’s needed to save a child's life – five small sachets of sugar and mineral salts mixed with water, at a cost of just seven cents each.<br />
		Over the last 20 years, UNICEF has managed to reach millions of children with ORS. In fact ORS is helping to save over 2,700 young lives every day. But diarrhoeal dehydration is still a grave threat to children in the developing world.<br />
		Poor sanitation and unsafe water are two of the conditions that cause diarrhoea. That is why nine months on from the floods that devastated Pakistan last year, although many lives have been saved, diarrhoea continues to threaten young lives.<br />
		<strong>A donation of just $125</strong> could help us provide enough ORS to save the lives of more than 350 children. Please join us in helping vulnerable children recover from diarrhoeal dehydration.</p><br />
