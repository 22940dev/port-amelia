		<p>As Australians we have become accustomed to seeing Timor-Leste (or East Timor as it is also known) in the media, yet from here it is difficult to comprehend the living conditions faced by these children. </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Disease and chronic malnutrition are common, particularly amongst children. </li>
        <li>More than 40 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line.</li>
        <li>The under-five mortality rate is 130 per 1,000 births. By comparison Australia’s under-five mortality rate is 6 per 1,000 births.</li>
        <li>More than one in ten Timorese children are acutely malnourished and almost 50 per cent suffer from chronic malnutrition. </li></ul>
		<p>Poor access to water and sanitation is one of the main causes of child malnutrition, which can lead to death. To address these concerns, UNICEF, in association with its partners, recently launched the WASH for Schools in Timor-Leste program.<br />
		The goals of the WASH (water and sanitation, and hygiene) program are precise, namely to give 6,000 children in 20 primary schools across the country access to safe and reliable drinking water and improved sanitation facilities, as well as training in good hygiene practices.<br />
		Please join us in helping our neighbour’s children grow up to be healthy and strong.</p><br />
