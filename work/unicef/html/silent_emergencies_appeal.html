        <p>UNICEF responded to over 290 emergencies in 2010 alone, but not many of these made the headlines. UNICEF's Silent Emergencies fund is a pool of readily available money for those emergencies you may not hear about, but require urgent support. <br />
		It's also for crises that have not yet happened, so that when they do hit we're prepared and can act quickly. <br />
		Here are some silent emergencies UNICEF is currently responding to:</p>
    	<ul>
        	<li>Darfur – Up to 300,000 people have died in Darfur, Sudan, since the start of the current conflict. The crisis continues to escalate and remains one of the biggest humanitarian crises of our time. Right now, UNICEF is helping to provide access to basic health services for three million people and providing access to clean water for 76 per cent of the population. </li>
            <li>Philippines – An average of 20 tropical cyclones hit the country each year with five to six causing significant damage. Last year, UNICEF and partners provided humanitarian assistance to over a million people, including treatment for 5,000 acutely malnourished children, and a successful immunisation program for children under five.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>A donation of just $260</strong> can provide 1,300 doses of measles vaccine, protecting children from this deadly disease.<br />
		<strong>A donation of just $125</strong> can buy 124 packets of high energy biscuits, specially developed for malnourished children in emergency situations. <br />
		Please join us in helping to ease children's suffering in emergencies.</p><br />
