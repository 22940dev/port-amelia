        <p>Sierra Leone has one of the highest infant and under-five mortality rates in the world. It’s shocking to think that one in seven children never reach the age of five. What’s more, one in eight women in Sierra Leone die of pregnancy or birth-related causes. That compares with one in 13,300 in Australia.<br />
		There are many reasons for these high rates, which include the lack of trained of health workers, the need for medical supplies, and lack of access to health care for women and children in remote communities.<br />
		Previously, the largest obstacle to maternal and child survival was the cost of health care. But with the support of UNICEF and other partners, the government of Sierra Leone introduced a Free Health Care policy, abolishing service fees and costs of medicines for all pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers and children under five.  This policy is expected to benefit 1.2 million mothers and children.<br />
		The program began in 2009 and aims to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Train and mobilise 800 community health workers.</strong> These workers are able to assist at births, ensure clean deliveries and umbilical cord care to avoid tetanus, as well as home visits after the births.</li>
        <li><strong>Educate communities about the simple measures that can improve children’s chance of survival.</strong>  With the help of a communication package and training manual to ensure women even in remote communities know about basic steps to keep themselves and their children healthy.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide life-saving supplies.</strong> The successful outcome of the first two activities relies on the provision of essential supplies such as vaccines, antibiotics, micronutrient supplements and insecticide treated bed nets. </li></ul>
		<p>Please help us build a better future for the mothers and children of Sierra Leone.</p><br />
