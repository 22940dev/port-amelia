		<p>Unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation are two of the biggest problems facing impoverished people in many parts of the world. If people are sick from serious diseases caused by poor sanitation or hygiene, like cholera or debilitating diarrhoea, they can't work, or go to school, or look after their families.<br />
		Access to clean water can help break the cycle of poverty. UNICEF has already made real progress in this area, helping establish facilities in schools and homes and creating fresh water supplies where needed.<br />
		UNICEF also works at a global level to provide infrastructure, educate people and promote hygienic practices.<br />
		<strong>A donation of just $140</strong> can buy 70 toilets in India, each used for a single home.<br />
		<strong>A donation of just $350</strong> can contribute to the cost of a mobile water purification unit that can purify 15m of water per hour. This is used to provide safe drinking water in an emergency.<br />
		Please join us in helping to improve people's lives.</p><br />
