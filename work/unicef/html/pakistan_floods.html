        <p>Children are always the most vulnerable in an emergency and the scale of the catastrophe that struck Pakistan in August 2010 is simply overwhelming.
        <ul>
        <li>The monsoonal rains flooded more than 795,000 square kilometres of land, placing one fifth of the country under water.</li>
    	<li>Over 20 million people have been affected including nine million children.</li>
   		<li>Around two million homes are thought to have been damaged or destroyed across Pakistan and only a fraction of the displaced has been issued tents.</li>
    	<li>Over 10, 000 schools are partially or completely damaged, with over 1,900 schools being used as accommodation for 216,000 people.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Since the devasting floods, UNICEF has been on the ground providing humanitarian operations and aid. Amongst other responses, UNICEF has:
        <ul>
        <li>Provided safe drinking water to 4.5 million people daily;</li>
	    <li>Vaccinated 9 million children have been against measles and polio;</li>
    	<li>Provided over 1.5 million people with sanitation facilities;</li>
    	<li>Set up Temporary Learning Centres and restored education services to more than 100,000 children.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>But nearly one year on and, despite the combined efforts of the world's largest charities, the situation is still desperate. Many people remain in need of life-saving humanitarian assistance and more funds are urgently needed. Please help us reach more vulnerable children and their families.</p><br />
