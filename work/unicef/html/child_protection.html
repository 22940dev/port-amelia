		<p><strong>Around 300 million children worldwide are subjected to abuse.</strong><br />
		They are either being trafficked, working as child soldiers, or undergoing harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation or child marriage. Others are forced into child labour, or are sexually exploited in the multi-billion-dollar commercial sex trade.<br />
		These are some of the many forms of violence, exploitation and abuse that happen to children around the world every day, and are a direct violation of their basic rights.</p>
        <p><strong>Quick Facts</strong> <br />
        <ul>
        <li>Around 218 million children worldwide could be considered child labourers. Around 57 per cent of them are engaged in hazardous work.</li>
        <li>Of the 1.39 million people involved in forced commercial sexual exploitation, 40 -50 per cent are children.</li>
        <li>At any given time, over 250,000 children are recruited or used in armed conflict.More than 1 million children are detained worldwide, the vast majority of whom have committed petty crimes or minor offences.</li>
        <li>Around 1.2 million children are trafficked worldwide every year.</li></ul>
		<p><strong>A protective environment for all children</strong><br />
		UNICEF works to create a protective environment for all children that prevents abuse, and provides support to children who have been victims. <br />
		UNICEFâ€™s work to protect children from abuse is in line with the Millennium Development Goals which show that child protection strengthens the development of communities.  UNICEF works for lasting change for children by working with governments, the private sector and communities to ensure that the protection rights of all children are realised.</p><br />
