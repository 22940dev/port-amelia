        <h3>"No child in Africa, and in fact anywhere in the world, should be denied education." - Nelson Mandela</h3>
		<p>Schools for Africa, a partnership between UNICEF, the Nelson Mandela Foundation and the Hamburg Society, aims to see all children within some of the poorest countries in Africa attending school.<br />
		Launched in late 2004, Phase 1 of the initiative aimed to provide basic quality education to four million children in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Due to its success, the program was expanded to benefit a further five million children in an additional five countries: Burkina Faso, Mali, Madagascar, Niger and Ethiopia.<br />
		Now UNICEF is working with governments, local authorities, communities and other partners to: </p>
        <ul>
        <li>build and rehabilitate schools.</li>
        <li>create schools that offer a safe and protective environment where children can learn and play.</li>
        <li>ensure schools give children access to clean water and sanitation facilities, including separate latrines for girls and boys.</li>
        <li>provide children with classroom and sports materials, as well as school furniture.</li>
        <li>train teachers to provide children with quality education and basic life skills.</li>
        <li>ensure children are informed about day-to-day hygiene and HIV prevention.</li></ul>
		<p>With your help, Schools for Africa will continue constructing and rehabilitating schools and providing education materials in 11 African countries. UNICEF will also continue to develop training programs for teachers and strengthen school management and community support for orphan students.<br />
		Please join us in ensuring children in Africa receive the education they need to break the poverty cycle.</p><br />
