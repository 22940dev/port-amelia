			<div class="AccordianSection">
			<p>UNICEF is one of the largest development agencies dedicated to working exclusively with children. UNICEF works closely with children, women and communities as well as governments, other UN agencies, faith-based groups, non-government organisations and the private sector on behalf of all children without regard to race, creed or religion.<br />
			UNICEF is unique among children's aid organisations as it has the global authority to influence and produce change in local policy and attitudes, for the good of children and their communities.<br />
			Through contact with UNICEF the lives of millions of children have been saved or changed for the better. But the challenge is ongoing -millions of children still need our help.</p>
