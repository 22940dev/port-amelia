        <p>East Africa is in the grips of one of the worst food security crises in the world today. Across Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti 12.4 million people, more than half the Australian population, are affected by the devastating crisis, including over 4.14 million children.<br />
In Southern Somalia a famine has been declared and over 300,000 children are on the brink of death, suffering from malnutrition.<br />
The crisis is caused by the convergent effects of the worst droughts, soaring food prices and the ongoing armed conflict within the country.<br />
Two emergencies are developing – one in over crowed camps for Somali refugees and another in the drought affected villages where lack of water, failed crops and dying livestock has resulted in a lack in food.<br />
Since the beginning of August UNICEF has delivered more than 530 metric tons of supplies – mostly highly nutritious food for treating malnourished children – to East Africa. Nearly half the tonnage was carried free of charge for UNICEF by airlines. Every $50 saved on air freight allows UNICEF to purchase 15 kilos of therapeutic food, enough to save one child’s life. </p>
		<h2>This is not just a food crisis. It is a crisis for child survival.</h2>
        <p>In addition to lack of food and water, malnourished children are even more susceptible to potential deadly diseases such as measles, malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia. And with one of the lowest immunisation rates in the world, malaria and measles epidemics are expected when the rains come in October.<br />
UNICEF is urgently working to scale up measles vaccination to 2.5 million children in Somalia, as well as immunising children against polio, measles and worms in Kenya and Ethiopia. UNICEF is also expanding the provision of safe water and sanitation by drilling boreholes, trucking in water tankers and providing vouchers to be exchanged for water<br />
Many of the 800,000 children who are currently displaced due to the drought and conflict are without family. These children are highly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse as campaigns to recruit children, including girls, into armed forces continue.</p>
		<h3>$10 vaccinates 50 children against measles.<br />
		$40 provides a months worth of special therapeutic food used to treat malnourished children.</h3>
        <h2>What UNICEF is doing</h2>
        <p>UNICEF is providing therapeutic food to tackle severe malnutrition, clean water and health services, vaccination campaigns and protection mechanisms for displaced children.</p>
        <ul>
   		<li>UNICEF has established 500 feeding centres in the south of Somalia and is working on reaching a total of 100,000 malnourished children.</li>
    	<li>Preventing disease outbreak with immunisation campaigns targeting 2 million children up to 15 years of age with measles vaccination.</li>
    	<li>Scaling up supplementary feeding to cover the gap of lack of food aid to reach 150,000 households over the next 2 months.</li>
    	<li>Expanding provision of safe water and access to sanitation by drilling/rehabilitating boreholes, water trucking, water vouchering and hygiene promotion to reach 300,000 children and their families through Outpatient Therapeutic Programs, 50,000 people at IDPs at camps/transit points and 30,000 people in host communities.</li>
        </ul>
	<p>At least every 90 cents of every dollar donated will reach the children of East Africa.</p><br />
