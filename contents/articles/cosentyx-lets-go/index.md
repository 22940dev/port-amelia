Let's Go is an iOS app I'm currently working on. It's a place for Psoriasis patents who use the drug Cosentyx to find support and information about their condition.

The process has been a little tricky, as the brief has continued to change throughout to meet the needs of various teams within Novartis, but we have now settled on both the content and visual design. Let's Go is a native iOS app for iPhone and iPad, and is about half way through development.

### My Approach

The design process for Let's Go has been a bit unusual because I was given (dated) designs for an existing app, which is now forming a section of our app, as well as a new set of branding which included the rainbow bursts pictured above. I absolutely loved the rainbow bursts and knew they had to be worked into the designs in a great way.

While I've kept a lot of the UI elements very simple, I've really enjoyed being able to play around with the bright colours and fun imagery. The purpose of the app is really to collect a lot of data about the patient in order to help with their condition, so we had to think of creative ways for the user to interact with these inputs and want to keep coming back.

A big challenge I'm facing is designing the layouts for iPad. Most of the screens don't have lots of content, so it's been interesting reworking the designs for the much bigger screen real estate while keeping them looking good, practical and useful.
