  <h3>About the Project</h3>
  <p>
    This is (or will be) the official website for UK actor, Rupert Graves. His <a href="http://rupert-graves.com" target="_blank" class="standard">current site</a> is rather dated, so we've been working to create something a little sexier and more modern.

  <h3>My Approach</h3>
  <p>
    This is still very much a work in progress. I've been through a few iterations but I'm yet to settle on something that I love. It's been interesting researching similar sites, and trying to decide what content is actually worth having on here as opposed to what's available elsewhere on the web.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm essentially creating a visual brand for Rupert, so I want it to be something that stands out and looks great.
