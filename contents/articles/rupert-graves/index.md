Rupert is an actor based in the UK with a decades-long resume under his belt. While his old, fan-maintained website was [truly glorious](https://web.archive.org/web/20161011054251/https://www.rupert-graves.com/), 2019 meant time for a change.

I designed and built the site myself from scratch, using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
