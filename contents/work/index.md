The WGSN style guide began as a simple tool for myself from which to grab the colors and logos for all our products. After a few months at WGSN, however, it became apparent there was no solid structure or style guide for how we were designing our products. Every UI element was being designed and coded over and over... always slightly differently. So, I took it upon myself to start creating a full style guide for the WGSN product team. The company also began a big rebrand project around this time, putting us in the perfect position to think about redesigning every UI element.
