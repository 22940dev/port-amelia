### What is it?

A key part of <a href="http://wgsn.com/" target="_blank" class="highlighted">WGSN</a>'s content is runway coverage from fashion week and other events, so it only made sense to make this even more available to our clients by bringing it straight to them in an app. The content is very simple&mdash;a feed of fashion shows, each with a collection of images and some with a review from one of the editors.
