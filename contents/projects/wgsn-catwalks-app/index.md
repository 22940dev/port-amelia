### What is it?

A key part of <a href="http://wgsn.com/" target="_blank" class="highlighted">WGSN</a>'s content is runway coverage from fashion week and other events, so it only made sense to make this even more available to our clients by bringing it straight to them in an app. The content is very simple&mdash;a feed of fashion shows, each with a collection of images and some with a review from one of the editors.

### The Design Process

My role in the initial version of this project was wire framing and interaction design, working with the visual designer on our team. The app's core function is to display a feed of fashion shows, along with some added features like filtering the collections, the ability to favourite images and push notifications.

The main challenge was deciding how to display the latest collections versus the entire archive, and whether that distinction even made sense. Beyond that, standard patterns for displaying images within an album were used with the addition of simple filtering like you'd see in any e-commerce product.
