<h3 data-title="What is it?">What is it?</h3>

City by City is one of WGSN's staple products, used heavily by the core group of <a href="https://www.wgsn.com/en/products/fashion/" target="_blank" class="highlighted">Fashion</a> and <a href="https://www.wgsn.com/en/products/lifestyle-interiors/" target="_blank" class="highlighted">Lifestyle &amp; Interiors</a> customers. It is somewhat of an editor-curated Yelp&mdash;hand-picked shopping, dining, accomodation and sightseeing choices from top cities around the world.

<h3 data-title="The Redesign">The Redesign</h3>

The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/style-traveler/id451178706?mt=8" target="_blank" class="highlighted">old</a> version of this app was a <em>little</em> dated, but we finally found some time to fit a rebuild into the roadmap. From a design perspective, not much in the way of UX or screen organisation actually needed to change, but the visuals were obviously in need of some attention. I wanted to bring this app up to scratch with our newer branding and interface styles, as well as make our apps feel as if they're all part of the same family.

The app is currently in development and should be released over the next couple of months. See the prototype below for the screen designs and interactions.
