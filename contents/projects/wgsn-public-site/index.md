### About

When I started at <a href="http://wgsn.com/" target="_blank" class="highlighted">WGSN</a>, the product and marketing teams were already most of the way through the redesign of their non-subscriber site. The goal was to refresh the look of the site and pull together the various product sites under the new "single platform" approach.

Flat designs for the desktop version of the site were done, and my task was to turn these into responsive designs that could work across all screens and devices.
